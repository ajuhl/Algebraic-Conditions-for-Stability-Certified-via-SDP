# Algebraic Conditions for Stability Certified via SDP

This is a supplementary materials repository for the paper "Algebraic Conditions for Stability in Runge-Kutta Methods and Their Certification via Semidefinite Programming" by Austin Juhl and David Shirokoff.

It includes rigorous certificates of A-stability for the examples presented in the paper in the form of symbolic matrices and the matlab code that generated the matrices.

The code here relies on CVX and Matlab.
