# Stability-in-Multistage-and-Multistep-Time-Integration-via-Semidefinite-Programming

This is a supplementary materials repository for the paper "Stability-in-Multistage-and-Multistep-Time-Integration-via-Semidefinite-Programming" by Austin Juhl and David Shirokoff.

It includes rigorous certificates of A-stability for the examples presented in the paper in the form of symbolic matrices and the matlab code that generated the matrices.

The code here relies on CVX and Matlab.
